# Necro-Paradox-Cards
Game made for game jam

It's a tabletop card based game, where by using energy the player can place skeletons on the specified slots on the board. There are 6 implemented skeletons with their own HP and ATK. There are also cards with dices, that can go back from 1 to 3 actions for the player or for the enemy. (The theme was bones/dices of time (ko≈õci czasu)). There was no goal implemented at the time and the gameplay was endless, but possibilities for upgrading a game like that are endless.
In 24 hours we made it playable, though some assets were imported at the end and don't show how they are supposed to (doesn't affect gameplay).
Made using Unity by a team formed by 4 people. 
We all managed different tasks, my primary one was to make assets in blender. (The only person that ever used blender)
I also helped with the coding a bit.
We used Git, but it was pretty messy, since not everyone used it before.
