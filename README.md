# Necro-Paradox-Cards
Game made for game jam

In 24 hours we made it playable, though some assets were imported at the end and don't show how they are supposed to. (doesn't affect gameplay)
Made using Unity by a team formed by 4 people. 
We all managed different tasks, my primary one was to make assets in blender. (The only person that ever used blender)
I also helped with the coding a bit.
We used Git, but it was pretty messy, since not everyone used it before.
