# Necro-Paradox-Cards
Game made during 24-hours hackathon (Bitehack) <br>
Made using Unity by a team formed by 4 people. <br>

It's a tabletop card based game, where by using energy the player can place skeletons on the specified slots on the board. There are 6 implemented skeletons with their own HP and ATK. There are also cards with dices, that can go back from 1 to 3 actions for the player or for the enemy. (The theme was bones/dices of time (ko≈õci czasu)). There was no goal implemented at the time and the gameplay was endless, but possibilities for upgrading a game like that are endless. <br>
In 24 hours we made it playable, though some assets were imported at the end and don't show how they are supposed to (doesn't affect gameplay). <br>
We all managed different tasks, my primary one was to make assets in blender. (The only person that ever used blender) <br>
I also helped with the coding a bit. <br>
We used Git, but it was pretty messy, since not everyone used it before.
